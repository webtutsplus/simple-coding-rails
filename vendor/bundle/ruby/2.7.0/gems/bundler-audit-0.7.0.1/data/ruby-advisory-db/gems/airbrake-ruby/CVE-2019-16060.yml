title: Blacklist keys are no longer being filtered in airbrake-ruby
description: |
  A flaw in airbrake-ruby v4.2.3 prevented user data from being filtered
  prior to sending to Airbrake. Such data could be user passwords. Therefore, an app
  could leak user passwords without knowing it.
unaffected_versions:
  - "< 4.2.3"
  - "> 4.2.3"
patched_versions:
  - ">= 4.2.4"
