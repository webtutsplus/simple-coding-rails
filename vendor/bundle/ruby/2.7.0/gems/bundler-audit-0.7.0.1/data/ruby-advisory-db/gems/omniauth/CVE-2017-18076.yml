title: omniauth leaks authenticity token in callback params
date: 2017-01-11

description: |
  In strategy.rb in OmniAuth before 1.3.2, the authenticity_token value is improperly protected because POST (in addition to GET) parameters are stored in the session and become available in the environment of the callback phase.

cvss_v2: 6.8
