description: |
  The cron_parser gem 0.1.4, 1.0.12, and 1.0.13 as distributed on RubyGems.org, included a
  code-execution backdoor inserted by a third party.

  No unaffected version is known to exist, as the gem appears to have been entirely removed.

  - "< 1.0.12"
  - "> 1.0.13"
  - "< 0.1.4"
  - "> 0.1.4"
