title: Improper handling of ssh known_hosts file with Chloride

description: |
  Prior to version 0.3.0, chloride's use of net-ssh resulted in host fingerprints
  for previously unknown hosts getting added to the user's known_hosts file without
  confirmation. In version 0.3.0 this is updated so that the user's known_hosts file
  is not updated by chloride.

cvss_v3: 5.0

patched_versions:
  - ">= 0.3.0"
