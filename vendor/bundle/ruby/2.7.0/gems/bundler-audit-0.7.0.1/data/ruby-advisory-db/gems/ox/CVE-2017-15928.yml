title: ox ruby gem segmentation fault via parse_obj
description: |
  In the Ox gem 2.8.0 for Ruby, the process crashes with a segmentation
  fault when a crafted input is supplied to parse_obj. NOTE: the vendor has stated
  "Ox should handle the error more gracefully" but has not confirmed a security implication.
