title: omniauth-saml authentication bypass via incorrect XML canonicalization and DOM traversal 
description: |
  OmniAuth OmnitAuth-SAML 1.9.0 and earlier may incorrectly utilize the
  results of XML DOM traversal and canonicalization APIs in such a way that an attacker
  may be able to manipulate the SAML data without invalidating the cryptographic signature,
  allowing the attack to potentially bypass authentication to SAML service providers.
