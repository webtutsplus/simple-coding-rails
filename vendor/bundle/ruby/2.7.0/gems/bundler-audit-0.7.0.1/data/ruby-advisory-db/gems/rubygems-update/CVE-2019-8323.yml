title: Escape sequence injection vulnerability in api response handling
date: 2019-03-05
description: |
  An issue was discovered in RubyGems 2.6 and later through 3.0.2.
  Gem::GemcutterUtilities#with_response may output the API response to stdout
  as it is. Therefore, if the API side modifies the response, escape sequence
  injection may occur.
unaffected_versions:
  - "< 2.6"
patched_versions:
  - ">= 3.0.3"
  - "~> 2.7.9"
