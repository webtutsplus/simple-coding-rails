title: rack-cors directory traversal via path
description: |
  An issue was discovered in the rack-cors (aka Rack CORS Middleware) gem
  before 1.0.4 for Ruby. It allows ../ directory traversal to access private resources
  because resource matching does not ensure that pathnames are in a canonical format.
patched_versions:
- ">= 1.0.4"
