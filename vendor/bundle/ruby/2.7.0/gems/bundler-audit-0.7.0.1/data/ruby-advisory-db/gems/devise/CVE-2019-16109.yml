title: Devise Gem for Ruby confirmation token validation with a blank string
date: 2019-09-08
description: |
  Devise before 4.7.1 confirms accounts upon receiving a request with a blank
  confirmation_token, if a database record has a blank value in the confirmation_token column.
  However, there is no scenario within Devise itself in which such database records would exist.

patched_versions:
  - ">= 4.7.1"
