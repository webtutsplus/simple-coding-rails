title: Escape sequence injection vulnerability in errors
date: 2019-03-05
description: |
  An issue was discovered in RubyGems 2.6 and later through 3.0.2. Since
  Gem::CommandManager#run calls alert_error without escaping, escape sequence
  injection is possible. (There are many ways to cause an error.)
unaffected_versions:
  - "< 2.6"
patched_versions:
  - ">= 3.0.3"
  - "~> 2.7.9"
