title: Malicious ruby gem - active-support
date: 2018-08-09

description: |
  The gem duplicates official `activesupport` (no hyphen) code, but adds a
  compiled extension. The extension attempts to resolve a base64 encoded
  domain, downloads a payload, and executes.

  Replace this gem with the official `activesupport` gem.
