title: Incorrect handling of initialization vector in the GCM mode in OpenSSL
description: |
  The openssl gem for Ruby uses the same initialization vector (IV) in
  GCM Mode (aes-*-gcm) when the IV is set before the key, which makes it easier for
  context-dependent attackers to bypass the encryption protection mechanism.
