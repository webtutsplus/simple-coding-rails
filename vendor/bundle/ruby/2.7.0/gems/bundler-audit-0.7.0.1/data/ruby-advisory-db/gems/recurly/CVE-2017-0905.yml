title: SSRF vulnerability in Recurly gem's Resource#find.

description: |
  If you are using the #find method on any of the classes that are derived from
  the Resource class and you are passing user input into that method, a
  malicious user can force the http client to reach out to a server under their
  control. This can lead to leakage of your private API key.

  Because of the severity of impact, we are recommending that all users upgrade
  to a patched version. We have provided a non-breaking patch for every 2.X
  version of the client.

patched_versions:
  - ~> 2.0.13
  - ~> 2.1.11
  - ~> 2.2.5
  - ~> 2.3.10
  - ~> 2.4.11
  - ~> 2.5.3
  - ~> 2.6.3
  - ~> 2.7.8
  - ~> 2.8.2
  - ~> 2.9.2
  - ~> 2.10.4
  - ~> 2.11.3
  - ">= 2.12.0"
