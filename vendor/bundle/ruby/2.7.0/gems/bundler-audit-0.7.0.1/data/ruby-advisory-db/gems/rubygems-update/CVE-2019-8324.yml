title: Installing a malicious gem may lead to arbitrary code execution
date: 2019-03-05
description: |
  An issue was discovered in RubyGems 2.6 and later through 3.0.2. A crafted
  gem with a multi-line name is not handled correctly. Therefore, an attacker
  could inject arbitrary code to the stub line of gemspec, which is eval-ed by
  code in ensure_loadable_spec during the preinstall check.

unaffected_versions:
  - "< 2.6"
patched_versions:
  - ">= 3.0.3"
  - "~> 2.7.9"
