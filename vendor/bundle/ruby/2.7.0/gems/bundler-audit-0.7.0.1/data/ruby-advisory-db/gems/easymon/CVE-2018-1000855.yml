title: Reflected XSS in Firefox in check endpoint
description: |
  When passing an invalid check name as parameter to the endpoint where
  the easymon routes are mounted, a 406 response with a body that contains the invalid
  check name unescaped is returned. Malicious JavaScript can be injected into that
  invalid name and have it executed in Firefox
