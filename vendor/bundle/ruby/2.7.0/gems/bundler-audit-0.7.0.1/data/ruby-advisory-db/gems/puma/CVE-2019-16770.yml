title: Keepalive thread overload/DoS in puma
description: |
  A poorly-behaved client could use keepalive requests to monopolize
  Puma's reactor and create a denial of service attack.

  If more keepalive connections to Puma are opened than there are
  threads available, additional connections will wait permanently if
  the attacker sends requests frequently enough.
