# `<web-share-wrapper>`

[![Published on webcomponents.org](https://img.shields.io/badge/webcomponents.org-published-blue.svg)](https://www.webcomponents.org/element/philnash/web-share-wrapper)

A custom element that can be used to wrap existing share buttons and replace them with a button that invokes the [Web Share API](https://philna.sh/blog/2017/03/14/the-web-share-api/).

For example, in supporting browsers the following HTML will show a plain `<button>` saying "Share". In browsers that don't support the Web Share API, the default link to share on Twitter will be displayed.

```html
<web-share-wrapper>
  <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Share+Text&amp;url=SHARE_URL">Share on Twitter</a>
</web-share-wrapper>
```

## How to use

The `<web-share-wrapper>` is a web component that you can use to enhance your website with the Web Share API. If the API is available, the component will replace its contents with a single share button or a template that you provide.

The component only activates if the Web Share API is available, otherwise it will just show it's contents.

### Browser support

Currently the only browser that supports the Web Share API (Chrome on Android) also supports custom elements and templates. So this module works where it will work and will fallback to your original HTML where it doesn't.

### Installation

#### Bower

You can install the component with bower.

```bash
bower install --save web-share-wrapper
```

#### npm

You can also install with npm.

```bash
npm install web-share-wrapper
```

Once installed, you can either use the minified version by referencing it from the `dist` directory.

```html
<script src="./node_modules/web-share-wrapper/dist/web-share-wrapper.min.js"></script>
```

Or if you have a build step, you can require the module.

```javascript
const WebShareWrapper = require('web-share-wrapper');
```

#### unpkg

If you want to use the component from the unpkg CDN then you can.

You can get the latest version using the bare URL. See more options on [https://unpkg.com/](https://unpkg.com/).

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/web-share-wrapper"></script>
```

### Example

```html
<web-share-wrapper>
  <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Share+Text&amp;url=SHARE_URL">Share on Twitter</a>
</web-share-wrapper>
```

If `navigator.share` is available, the contents of the `<web-share-wrapper>` will be replaced with a single `<button>` element, which when clicked will invoke the Web Share API.

### Attributes

You can set attributes to control the text on the share button and the text and URL that is shared. The available attributes are:

- **text**: Sets the text on the share button.
- **template**: An id for a `<template>` element. The component will find the template, hydrate it and add it as the child of the component. This overrides the `text` attribute.
- **sharetitle**: Sets the title to be shared.
- **sharetext**: Sets the text to be shared. Falls back to the text contents of the `<title>` element.
- **shareurl**: Sets the URL to be shared. Fallsback to the `href` of the canonical link, failing that `window.location.href`.

```html
<web-share-wrapper text="Share this" sharetitle="This amazing thing was shared" sharetext="You should really click on the link to learn more" shareurl="http://example.com/amazing">
  <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Share+Text&amp;url=SHARE_URL">Share on Twitter</a>
</web-share-wrapper>
```

### Events

The `<web-share-wrapper>` emits one of two events in response to the result of using `navigator.share`.

If the share is successful then a `share-success` event is fired. The share title, text and URL are emitted in the `event`'s `details` (though the user may have edited them in the share target).

If the share is unsuccessful then a `share-failure` event is fired. The share title, text, URL and the error that was thrown are emitted in the `event`'s `details`.
